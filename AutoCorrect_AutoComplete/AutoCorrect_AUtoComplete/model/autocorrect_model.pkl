The file model/autocorrect_model.pkl is a binary file that stores the trained autocorrect model in a serialized format. As such, it cannot be represented as text content. This file is typically generated by training a model using a machine learning library, and its contents are not meant to be manually edited or viewed.

Therefore, this file is intentionally left blank.
