# 🔤 AutoCorrect + AutoComplete Web App

This is a web application that combines:
- ✅ **Autocomplete** using your own trained prefix model
- ✅ **Autocorrect** using a pretrained BERT model from [NeuSpell](https://github.com/neuspell/neuspell)

No ML training is required for autocorrect — it's all plug-and-play!

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Instant Autocomplete suggestions from a prefix dictionary
- ✨ Real-time Spelling Correction powered by pretrained BERT
- 💻 Frontend in HTML + CSS with responsive design
- 🔄 Powered by Flask for backend APIs

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

| Component     | Technology       |
|---------------|------------------|
| Autocomplete  | Trained prefix `.pkl` model |
| Autocorrect   | NeuSpell pretrained BERT model |
| Backend       | Flask             |
| Frontend      | HTML, CSS, JS     |

## ⚙️ Installation

1. **Clone this repository** or copy files to a folder.
2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

3. **(One-time)** The first time `Neuspell` is used, it will download a pretrained model (\~400MB).

---

## ▶️ Run the App

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your browser and go to:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

---

## 📌 Notes

* The autocomplete model must be pre-trained and saved as:

  ```
  model/autocomplete_model.pkl
  ```

* The autocorrect model is loaded automatically from NeuSpell:

  ```python
  from neuspell import BertChecker
  checker = BertChecker()
  checker.from_pretrained()
  ```

* If you want to use a different pretrained model (e.g. RobertaChecker), you can change `BertChecker` to another available option in NeuSpell.

## 🙌 Credits

* [NeuSpell](https://github.com/neuspell/neuspell) for pretrained spelling models
* You — for training your own autocomplete!
